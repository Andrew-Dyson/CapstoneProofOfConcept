<h2>For those having problems getting the fetch request to work, the solution that worked for me is to pip install flask-cors and then modify the api.py file as follows:</h2>
import time
from flask import Flask 
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/time')
def get_current_time():
    print(f"request received at {time.time()}")
    return {"time": time.time()}
